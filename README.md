To compile and run the source code, you will need a C compiler installed on your computer, such as GCC or Clang. Here are the steps you can follow:

### 1. Compilation

To compile the source code, run the following command in the terminal:
``` bash
gcc -o q1-backend q1-backend.c
```
This will compile the source code and generate an executable file named `q1-backend`.

### 2. Excecution
To run the program, execute the following command:
```bash
./q1-backend
```
This will run the program and print the output to the terminal.

**Note:** If you encounter any errors during compilation or execution, make sure to check that you have the necessary dependencies installed and that the source code file is saved correctly.
